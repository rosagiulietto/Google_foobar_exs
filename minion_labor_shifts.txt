ESERICIZIO:
Write a function called solution(data, n) 
that takes in a list of less than 100 integers and a number n, 
and returns that same list 
but with all of the numbers that occur more than n times removed entirely. 
The returned list should retain the same ordering as the original list - 
you don't want to mix up those carefully-planned shift rotations! 
For instance, if data was [5, 10, 15, 10, 7] and n was 1,
solution(data, n) would return the list [5, 15, 7] because 10 occurs twice, 
and thus was removed from the list entirely

VINCOLI:
Your code will run inside a Python 2.7.13 sandbox. 
All tests will be run by calling the solution() function.

Standard libraries are supported 
except for bz2, crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, 
signal, termios, thread, time, unicodedata, zipimport, zlib.

Input/output operations are not allowed.

Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length 
including new lines and and other non-printing characters.

TEST CASES
==========
Your code should pass the following test cases.
Note that it may also be run against hidden test cases not shown here.

-- Python cases --
Input:
solution.solution([1, 2, 3], 0)
Output:
    

Input:
solution.solution([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5], 1)
Output:
    1,4
